# Classic algorithms implemented in JS

This repository is a part of my personal project. There are three main objectives of this project:

* to refresh my knowledge of classic algorithms
* to get more fluent in ES6
* to get fluent in parallel thinking in Python and ES6 

I go along with Khan Academy's Algorithms course (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) but I'm trying to translate everything to ES6 and sometimes I do implement things in a different way.

I do parallel Python implementations of all the algos in Python 3.6 as well (not included in this repo).
